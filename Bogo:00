AB  Based on new evidence and a deeper understanding of the meaning and causes
    of poverty, the World Bank's World Development Report 2000/2001: Attacking
    Poverty argues that major reductions in world poverty are indeed possible.
    Economic development continues to be central to success in reducing poverty.
    But poverty is also an outcome of economic, social, and political processes
    that interact with and reinforce each other in ways that can ease or
    exacerbate the state of deprivation in which poor people live. To conquer
    poverty requires actions - at the local, national, and global levels - to
    expand poor people's opportunities, empower them, and increase their
    security.

AB  The financial crises that gripped much of east Asia at the turn of 1998
    reached out to emerging market economies in other regions, including central
    and eastern Europe and the CIS.  The contagion effects from the east Asian
    crsises provided a stress test for emerging market economies in other
    regions.  The lessons drawn from the impact of contagion effects on the
    post-communist countries reinforce the lessons learned from the turmoil in
    east Asia itself and from previous crises.  The build-up of short-term debt,
    either in domestic or international markets, was a major contributing factor
    in the speed and intensity of the east Asian turmoil and the 1994 Mexican
    crisis.  The rapid credit growth, inadequately disciplined by the legal and
    regulatory framework was also a factor in the east Asian and Mexican crises.
    And large fiscal deficits and weak revenues were key factors in balance of
    payments crises in Latin America in the 1980s.  For the post-communist
    countries strong progress in transition and macroeconomic prudence will be
    their best position.

    household income inequality in urban and rural China, decompose inequality
    into intra- and interprovincial components, and analyze the contribution of
    various income sources to total income equality.  The main findings are,
    first, that unlike in most developing economies, income inequality in urban
    areas is lower than in rural areas.  Second, nationwide income inequality is
    due mostly to intraprovincial inequality.  Third, components of income
    associated with economic reforms are more unequally distributed than the
    rest.

AB  According to an article by Jefferson and Rawski, entitled How Industrial
    Reform Worked in China: The Role of Innovation, Competition, and Property
    Rights, the central driving force behind China's industrial sector reform is
    intense competition between state-owned and town and village enterprises,
    which, by eroding the profits of state enterprises, spurs them to innovate. 
    Further, since profits constitute a key element of the tax base, reducing
    profits lowers the tax revenue, thereby hardening the government budget
    constraint.  The government responds by reducing subsidies to enterprises,
    forcing them to maintain the momentum of innovation.  Then by drawing
    lessons from the success of previous reforms, the government embarks on the
    next round of reforms.  However, this article is silent about the fate of
    enterprises that are unable, or unwilling, to compete.  There are aso
    questions about the strength of the empirical evidence provided in support
    of the analysis, particularly concerning profit and innovative activity.

AB  The objectives of taxation should be similar for developed and developing
    countries - to raise resources for government expenditure in a way that is
    administratively feasible, equitable, and efficient.  The main differences
    between developed and developing countries lie in the constraints facing
    government.  It is a mistakle to see the tax problem as simply one of
    financing a given aggregate expenditure.  While expenditure must be
    controlled, this challenge cannot be tackled simply by reducing expenditure
    to negligible levels.  The structure of taxation in developing countries
    looks radically different from that of developed countries.  In developed
    countries roughly 2/3 of tax revenue comes from indirect taxes, 1/3 from
    direct taxes.  The ratio is just the opposite in developing countries.  The
    objective of positive tax theory should be the design of feasible reforms
    and the tracing of the effects of tax changes through to changes in not only
    revenue but also household real income.

AB  The normative theory of taxation and its relation with production planning
    for a static economy constitute a substantial body of literature.  The
    problems and issues that arise when an attempt is made to extend the static
    theory of taxation and production planning to a dynamic context and to
    combine that theory with theories of growth are examined.  Specifically, 3
    dynamic policy issues that can be set within the standard framework given by
    the dynamic reinterpretation of the static model are discussed: 1.  the tax
    base, 2.  the process of adjustment, and 3.  pensions and transfers across
    generations.  Dynamic theory is less developed in part because of problems
    with the analytical tractability of even those dynamic models that attempt
    to retain the basic structure of the static model.  Furthermore, difficult
    and interesting issues arise in a dynamic context that are either not
    present or are much less severe in the static theory.

AB  Economic theory and empirical analysis can make a substantial and
    constructive contribution to providing well-founded policy prescriptions in
    economic development.  However, it should not be assumed that a single set
    of prescriptions can be applied to all countries.  While there are basic
    principles and methods of analysis from economics, what they will yield in
    any particular application will depend on the economic structure,
    institutions, political framework, and administrative capability of the
    countries involved.  The state should take an active role in health,
    education, infrastructure, the legal and regulatory framework, and
    protection of the poor.  In the production of standard outputs, such as
    steel, automobiles, and ice cream, the state should concentrate on providing
    a constructive and competitive environment.  There is no contradiction
    between a major state commitment in the above areas and a vibrant sector. 
    Instead, an important positive connection is expected.  These areas provide
    a major role for governments.

AB  The application of theory and a systematic accumulation of data and their
    analysis have advanced the understanding of growth.  At the same time,
    growth theories, be they of the 1960s or 1980s, leave much to be desired in
    their explanation of the growth experience.  The theories have shown an
    excessive concern with the long-run growth of total factor productivity and
    have made only a limited contribution to explaining it.  They also omit many
    issues that are probably crucial to growth in the medium run, including
    economic organization and the social and physical infrastructure.  There is
    still much to learn about the 6 factors that have been identified as
    contributing to growth and about the role of the state in improving their
    contribution.  In the future, economists will be greatly advantaged by
    longer runs of data on different countries and by the more sophisticated
    microeconomic theories of competition, information, and technical progress
    that have been developed.

AB  An analysis of the theory of public policy in an economy with distortions
    shows that the use of shadow prices can provide a unifying theme for the
    theory and a simplification of results.  The analysis defines a shadow price
    as a social opportunity cost, which is the net loss or gain in social
    welfare associated with increased use or decreased production in the public
    sector.  The analysis shows that these shadow prices can be very sensitive
    to the way in which the economy reacts to a change in public production,
    although the rules for shadow prices do not depend on whether public
    production is optimized or not.  The fact that shadow revenue has the same
    relationship to nominal revenue as shadow prices have to market prices means
    that government revenue can be incorporated into the theory of public
    policy.  The analysis shows how important shadow prices should be calculated
    and how the proposed approach can be used to structure the analysis of
    important applied problems.

AB  Standard models for the design or reform of indirect taxes for developed
    countries usually take the production sector to be undistorted.  However,
    for developing countries, economists have been much concerned with
    distortions that arise from various market imperfections and government
    actions that cause the incentives embodied in the relative market prices
    facing producers to be very different from the relative social opportunity
    costs.  Using data from Pakistan, it is shown how the appraisal of indirect
    taxes can take account of distortions on the production side by integrating
    shadow prices into the analysis of reform.  The role of the divergence of
    market and shadow prices is stressed.  It is seen that the effect on the
    rankings of goods as candidates for extra taxation may be strong.  Goods
    with high shadow prices are valuable, and the tax system should take this
    into account in discouraging their consumption.

AB  In a roundtable discussion, Amartya Sen of Harvard University says that the
    private sector has various shortcomings in dealing with such problems as
    those discussed in the literature, e.g., public goods and situations of
    strong externalities.  However, when one looks at different countries with
    different types and extents of public sector activism, one finds that some
    countries have benefited considerably from such activism.  Nicholas Stern of
    the London School of Economics focuses on the meaning of "public" and
    "private," the reasons for state action, and the consequences of state
    action.  He argues that an examination of the reasons and consequences
    provide strong pointers as to where and when the state should be involved. 
    The remarks of Joseph Stiglitz of Stanford University deal with what
    economic science has to say about the appropriate roles of the state and the
    private sector.  Stanley Fischer of the World Bank notes that the role of
    democracy, as emphasized by Sen, deserves consideration regarding its effect
    on Bank operations.

AB  A survey is presented of the economics of development, that is, the use of
    economic analysis to understand the economics of poor or developing
    countries.  The achievements in development economics are presented in terms
    of: 1.  the concern for the grand issues of development strategy and the
    process of growth, 2.  the formulation and analysis of policy techniques,
    and 3.  the specially focused micro study.  The grand issues include: 1. 
    the role of the state, 2.  the process of growth and change, 3.  the
    influence of industrialization and trade, 4.  relations between developed
    and developing countries, and 5.  population and the economy.  The study of
    methods for planning, for cost-benefit analysis, and for pricing and
    taxation provides an important example of areas where development economics
    has been a leader in theoretical and technical understanding in economics. 
    The detailed micro studies provide the foundation of the subject.  Examples
    are chosen primarily from the analysis of rural markets.

AB  An examination of alcohol consumption in the state of Karnataka in southern
    India focuses on: 1.  investigating the determinants of recorded demand for
    alcohol, especially arrack, in terms of price and income elasticities,
    taxation, and household characteristics, 2.  developing an analysis of some
    simple theoretical aspects of the revenue system in the state, involving the
    auction of the monopoly rights to sell legally in a district, and 3. 
    combining these elements to comment on policy in Karnataka.  The analysis is
    based on an annual time series for the period 1970-1981 and 2 cross sections
    of households, one for 1973-1974 and one for 1977-1978.  In pursuing these
    objectives, some techniques are demonstrated and insights provided that can
    be used productively for a range of problems in developing countries.  If
    the government's main objective is revenue, then enforcement resources
    should be concentrated on controlling the large illicit sector, thereby
    raising demand, profits, and auction revenues, and specific taxes should be
    abolished.

AB  It is common for economic agents to confront nonlinear pricing schedules. 
    This poses difficulties for the estimation of demand functions but also
    advantages in that there is price variation in a cross section.  This is
    illustrated with 2 examples from Pakistan: 1.  the urban rationing of wheat,
    and 2.  the demand for wheat by rural households that produce and consume
    wheat.  In the first case, consumers have to pay higher prices for purchases
    above the ration, and in the 2nd, buying and selling prices vary.  Demand
    elasticities are estimated using maximum likelihood procedures.  These
    estimates are much different from those obtained using standard Linear
    Expenditure System (LES) assumptions.  The price elasticities estimated with
    the model here are much larger in absolute size than the Extended LES
    estimates and the income elasticities much lower.

AB  Many government contracts with policies toward oligopolistic sectors
    basically involve private companies selling a certain proportion or quantity
    of output to the government at a fixed price, while the rest is sold on the
    open market.  The impact of government tax and regulation policies toward
    oligopolistic and monopolistically competitive industries is examined. 
    Using a simple 2-parameter framework, the possible government policies are
    captured.  The formal analysis concentrates on the system of dual pricing in
    India.  Monopolistic competition is introduced as a perfect equilibrium in a
    model of conjectural variation oligopoly.  Welfare economic aspects of the
    schemes are investigated, focusing on aggregate consumer welfare.  The
    influence of increasing the proportion of output taken by the government can
    be positive or negative.  The full optimum (ignoring distribution) involves
    total government takeover and price equal to marginal cost, but movements in
    that direction from a given beginning position may not be welfare improving.

AB  Tax systems can be evaluated by: 1.  examining value judgments of a social
    welfare function within a model of the economy and its initial equilibrium,
    2.  using an inverse optimum approach, or 3.  seeking to find Pareto
    improvements.  It is shown how these approaches may be implemented, and the
    interrelations between them are revealed.  The methods are illustrated
    through an empirical examination of tax reform possibilities in India. 
    Marginal cost is defined in terms of the welfare of raising an extra rupee
    from the ith good.  Marginal reforms only are considered, and the focus is
    on consumer welfare and the government revenue constraint.  Necessary data
    are: 1.  household demands, 2.  taxes, 3.  aggregate demand derivatives, and
    4.  welfare weights.  A method for calculating the Pareto improvement and
    the inverse optimum is presented and applied to data from the Indian economy
    for 1979-1980.  If a Pareto improvement is not possible, the
    Minkowski-Farkas lemma shows that a solution, with non-negative welfare
    weights, to the inverse optimum problem exists.

AB  A unified sequence of models is used under oligopolistic conditions to
    examine the determinants of: 1.  price, 2.  output, 3.  profitability, and
    4.  concentration.  The analysis is based on explicit models, allowing
    relevant measures of structure and performance to come forward.  In the
    welfare analysis, the deadweight loss is computed and associated directly
    with oligopolistic equilibrium without use of proxies.  Important aspects of
    welfare judgment and policy are examined: 1.  consumer surplus, 2.  profit,
    3.  added benefits of employment, and 4.  trade surplus.  In relating these
    aspects to the size and concentration of markets, several Herfindahl indices
    are found to be very helpful.  This extension of theory into international
    trade is particularly relevant for the operation of transnational firms in
    less developed countries.

AB  A comparison is made of the welfare levels which can be reached by 2
    different tax regimes: lump-sum taxation, in which an attempt is made to
    identify individuals and allocate transfer or subsidies on the basis of
    characteristics, and income taxation, where characteristics are not observed
    but personal incomes are measured and taxed.  A very simple model is used
    which is presented with general functional forms.  The potential of
    different policies such as optimum income taxation is discussed, and a
    diagrammatic treatment of the different tax schemes is provided.  Constant
    elasticity of substitution utility functions and a Cobb-Douglas production
    function for the 2 types of labor are used.  It is found that where there
    are no errors in classifying individuals, lump-sum taxation is superior, but
    where errors are made in the allocation of lump-sum grants or subsidies,
    income taxation may be more attractive.  The level of errors where the
    regimes are equally desirable in terms of social welfare is calculated, and
    it is found that where there is strong aversion to inequality, income
    taxation becomes preferable at rather small errors.  In analyzing income
    taxation, it is demonstrated that with endogenous wages the marginal tax
    rate (in optimum income taxation) on the more skilled is negative and that
    on the less skilled is positive, in contrast to standard results with
    exogenous wages.
