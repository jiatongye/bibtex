 distributions of organizations and contracts are shown to be functions of
 the underlying primitives, in particular, the distribution of
 Pareto weights, and hence degree of inequality. Internal
 inequality of a potential, local group is a force for collective
 organization. That is, multi-agent organizations exist in order to
 extract wealth from some but not necessarily all members. The group
 organization is also shown to be information-constrained Pareto
 optimal at extremes of local wealth relative to an outsider.
 However, the group organization is susceptible to both agents
 simultaneously deviating, colluding against the outsider, and this
 distortion makes an individualistic, relative performance contract
 an attractive alternative.'"
