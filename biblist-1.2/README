There is an often asked question: `How can I print a listing with all
entries of a BibTeX database?'. The common answer is: `Use
\nocite{*}.'

Well, but this will not work for large BibTeX databases unless you
use BigTeX. This is because for each entry a TeX macro is declared
and TeX's pool size capacity (where macro names are stored) will be
exceeded soon.

    
This style option is appropriate to create a typeset listing of a
(possibly large) BibTeX input file. With such large files --
especially, if the cite keys are long -- the needed string space is
often exceeded. Often a BigTeX is available to circumstance this
problem, but with this style option each TeX will do it.

You have to prepare a LaTeX document which uses the |article|
style and the biblist style option. You may add almost all other
style options, as you wish, e.g., twoside, german (or other
language style options), a4, etc. This style option must be used
with a ragged bottom; this has the effect, that it cannot be used with
twocolumn or multicol.

You must issue a \bibliography tag which names all BibTeX
databases which you want to print. You may issue a
\bibliographystyle tag to specify how BibTeX will process its
databases. (In fact, you usually must issue it since the default
bibliography style is not available on most installations; see
below.) You may issue \nocite commands if you want to print only
selected entries from the databases.


A ``bug'' you may encounter is that \cite tags within
BibTeX entries will not be processed. Instead the cite key itself
will be printed. Note that this is not a bug, this is a feature! You
have to use \nocite tags for *all* entries that shall be
included in the listing. If you do not give any \nocite tag at all,
a listing with all entries is created.

Note that this style option assumes that you use either LaTeX~2.09
released after December 1991, ILaTeX, or the babel system.
Particulary, it requires the definition of \refname which is supplied
by these systems. (Of course, you may supply this definition by
yourself.)


The entries in the resulting listing are formatted as follows:

\tt cite key ................................... \sf (Library info)
    Author(s).
Title.
Publication info.
Notes.
    \footnotesize Annotation

I.e., an open format is used. Although this needs more space I think
the enhanced legibility pays back.

Note that you will not get the `Library info' and the `Annotation' in
the above format if your bibliography style does not supply this
information with the assumed markup. The parenthesis around the library
info are produced by this style option, not by BibTeX.


Enjoy. btw, this style is supported since I use it myself :-)
