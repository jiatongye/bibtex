*'There is evidence from several sources that one cannot treat
 many-person households as a single decision maker. If this is the
 case, then factors such as the relative incomes of the household
 members may affect the final allocation decisions made by the
 household. A method of identifying how incomes affect outcomes,
 given conventional family expenditure data, is developed. The
 basic assumption the analysis makes is that household decision
 processes lead to efficient outcomes. The method is applied to a
 sample of Canadian couples with no children. The analysis finds
 that the final allocations of expenditures on each partner depend
 significantly on their relative incomes and ages and on the level
 of lifetime wealth. These effects are highly significant in a
 statistical sense. They also suggest that the influence of
 differential incomes and wealth on intrahousehold allocation can be
 fairly substantial.'"

*'In microeconomic theory, the household is essentially
 considered to be the basic decision unit. This traditional framework,
 however, has recently been challenged by several economists, who
 have developed so-called collective approaches to household
 behavior. A 'good' collective theory of household behavior must both
 generate falsifiable restrictions and allow one to uniquely
 recover the members' preferences and the decision process. A simple
 model of labor supply, with a single (aggregate) consumption
 good, is considered. Under certain assumptions, it is shown that: 1.
 testable restrictions on the labor supply function can be
 derived from both the parametric and nonparametric viewpoints, and 2.
 the sharing rule can be recovered from labor supplies up to an
 additive constraint.'"

 Survey data are obtained from the Enquete Fiscale in France and
 the Family Expenditure Survey in the UK. The value of the
 international comparisons for the discussion of tax reform lies in
 studying the implications of applying a UK tax code to the French
 population (or vice versa). The French tax code is redistributive
 in the 2 dimensions considered -- income and family size.
 However, there has been pressure for reform, with one target being the
 familial quotient. The dominance conditions are not satisfied
 by a reform replacing the quotient by a UK-style standard
 deduction. In order to secure dominance, a package of measures, such as
 raising child benefits, is needed. The devising of tax reform
 is not straightforward, and for this reason, the development of
 accessible tax-benefit models is of great importance.'"
