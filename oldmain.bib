   abstract  = {We present the evidence of government intervention in rural
       credit markets of LDC's in the past three decades and 
       confront it with modern theory.  That evidence shows a 
       significant failure of subsidized credit programs either to
       achieve an increase of agricultural output cost-effectively
       or to improve rural income distribution and alleviate 
       poverty.  In addition, many of the financial institutions
       that were created to channel rural credit have been shown
       to be inept and lacking accountability.
       Modern theory has focused mostly on two areas, credit
       rationing in competitive markets and interlinking of 
       credit contracts with labor and land contracts.  We outline 
       the policy implications of these thories and find them 
       insufficient to account for the empirical evidence. We 
       contend that a more systematic and rigorous analysis of 
       institutions and institutional environments is essential
       for understanding and implementing effective policy
       reforms of rural credit markets.  We present suggestions
       for undertaking such an analysis.}

       imperfect information in the context of credit markets in 
       rural northern Nigeria.  In much recent theoretical 
       literature, the problems of moral hazard and adverse
       selection are assumed to be decisive for the organaization 
       of agrarian institutions.  In contrast, it is found that in
       the four villages surveyed credit transactions take 
       advantage of the free flow of information within rural 
       communities.  Information asymmetries between borrower
       and lender are unimportant, and their institutional
       consequences --- the use of collateral and interlinked 
       contracts --- are absent.  Credit transactions play a 
       direct role in pooling risk between households through the
       use of contracts in which the repayment owed by the borrower
       depends on the realization of random production shocks by 
       both the borrower and the lender.}
