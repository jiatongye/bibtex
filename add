1. Bergstrom, Theodore C.
     Economics in a family way.
   Journal of Economic Literature v34, n4 (Dec 1996):1903-1934.
     Pub type:  Studies; Experimental.

Abstract: An examination is made of the implications of the hypothesis that
     human preferences were shaped by natural selection, acting through
     differential effects of preferences on rates of reproduction.  A
     genetically based theory of the evolution of interpersonal sympathy among
     family members is outlined.  The theory of cultural evolution is
     discussed.  It is argued that natural selection of culturally transmitted
     preferences and attitudes operates according to a logic similar to that of
     natural selection of genetically transmitted traits.  Evolutionary notions
     are then applied to the riddle of the demographic transition and to
     patterns of intergenerational flows of wealth.  The results of studies of
     nonmonogamous family structures in traditional societies are related to
     more recent work on nonmonogamous family relations.  Research that has
     potential for inspiring important advances in the economic theory of the
     family is discussed.  An approach to intrafamily bargaining is advocated
     that is based on noncooperative bargaining theory.

1. Honore, Bo E; Kyriazidou, Ekaterini; Udry, Christopher.
     Estimation of Type 3 Tobit models using symmetric trimming and pairwise
     comparisons.
   Journal of Econometrics v76, n1-2 (Jan/Feb 1997):107-128.
     Pub type:  Studies; Experimental.

Abstract: Estimation of the semiparametric Type 3 Tobit model is considered.
     Two-step estimators are constructed that use the ideas of symmetric
     trimming and pairwise comparisons which have been proposed for the
     censored regression model by Powell (1986) and Honore and Powell (1994).
     The estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal under 2
     identifying assumptions: conditional symmetry and independence between the
     errors and regressors.  The ideas and techniques are also implementable in
     other selection models that are variations of the basic Type 3 Tobit
     model.  This is demonstrated by applying the proposed method in estimating
     an empirical model considered by Udry (1994).
