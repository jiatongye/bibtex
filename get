1. Fafchamps, Marcel.
     Sovereign debt, structural adjustment, and conditionality.
   Journal of Development Economics v50, n2 (Aug 1996):313-335.
     Pub type:  Studies; Experimental.

Abstract: The lack of a proper enforcement mechanism for sovereign debt
     generates a commitment failure.  As a result, a sovereign may seek to
     improve its position in debt renegotiations and thus evade its debt
     obligations by reducing exports.  Conditionality seeks to provide a
     solution to the incentive problem by addressing the commitment failure.
     Formalizing this argument, it is shown that conditionality helps the
     repayment of sovereign debt.  In certain circumstances, it can eliminate
     debt overhang, especially when it is coupled with concessionary lending of
     sufficient magnitude.  It is however, unable to restore first best.  When
     it is anticipated by lenders, conditionality may get international
     financial institutions and sovereign debtors into a trap where the debt
     overhang persists, debt rescheduling takes place periodically and
     conditionality continues indefinitely.

     The effects of economic and population growth on national saving and
     inequality.
   Demography v34, n1 (Feb 1997):97-114.
     Pub type:  Studies; Experimental.

Abstract: A progress report is presented on ongoing research into the effects
     of economic and population growth on national saving rates and inequality.
     The theoretical basis for the investigation is the life cycle model of
     saving and inequality.  Evidence is reported that is conditional on the
     validity of the model, as well as evidence that casts doubt on it.  Using
     time series of cross-sectional household surveys from Taiwan, Thailand,
     Britain, and the US, it is shown that it is possible to force a life cycle
     interpretation on the data on consumption, income, and saving, but that
     the evidence is not consistent with large rate-of-growth effects, whereby
     economic and population growth enhances rates of national saving.  The
     well-established cross-country link between economic growth and saving
     cannot be attributed to life cycle saving, nor will changes in economic or
     population growth exert large effects on saving within individual
     countries.  There is evidence in favor of the life cycle model's
     prediction that within-cohort inequality of consumption and of total
     income should increase with the age of the cohort.

     Rationing, spillover, and interlinking in credit markets:  The case of
     rural Punjab.
   Oxford Economic Papers v49, n4 (Oct 1997):557-585.
     Pub type:  Studies; Experimental.

Abstract: A parallel market structure may exhibit extensive rationing in the
     regulated segment, and hence spillover of unsatisfied demand into the
     unregulated segment of the market.  In the latter segment, the borrower
     can choose to bundle loan contracts with output marketing through the
     lender.  Using data on Punjabi cultivators, econometric estimation of such
     a structure yields 3 principal findings: 1.  Most borrowers and
     non-borrowers were rationed in the regulated market.  2.  Demand for
     credit was fairly inelastic with respect to the interest rate.  3.  A
     contractual provision tying credit to output marketing made informal
     lenders willing to advance much bigger loans.
