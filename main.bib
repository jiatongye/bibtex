		  Enquete Fiscale in France and the Family Expenditure Survey
		  in the UK. The value of the international comparisons for
		  the discussion of tax reform lies in studying the
		  implications of applying a UK tax code to the French
		  population (or vice versa). The French tax code is
		  redistributive in the 2 dimensions considered -- income and
		  family size. However, there has been pressure for reform,
		  with one target being the familial quotient. The dominance
		  conditions are not satisfied by a reform replacing the
		  quotient by a UK-style standard deduction. In order to
		  secure dominance, a package of measures, such as raising
		  child benefits, is needed. The devising of tax reform is
		  not straightforward, and for this reason, the development
		  of accessible tax-benefit models is of great importance.'"

		  considered to be the basic decision unit. This traditional
		  framework, however, has recently been challenged by several
		  economists, who have developed so-called collective
		  approaches to household behavior. A 'good' collective
		  theory of household behavior must both generate falsifiable
		  restrictions and allow one to uniquely recover the members'
		  preferences and the decision process. A simple model of
		  labor supply, with a single (aggregate) consumption good,
		  is considered. Under certain assumptions, it is shown that:
		  1. testable restrictions on the labor supply function can
		  be derived from both the parametric and nonparametric
		  viewpoints, and 2. the sharing rule can be recovered from
		  labor supplies up to an additive constraint.'"

		  treat many-person households as a single decision maker. If
		  this is the case, then factors such as the relative incomes
		  of the household members may affect the final allocation
		  decisions made by the household. A method of identifying
		  how incomes affect outcomes, given conventional family
		  expenditure data, is developed. The basic assumption the
		  analysis makes is that household decision processes lead to
		  efficient outcomes. The method is applied to a sample of
		  Canadian couples with no children. The analysis finds that
		  the final allocations of expenditures on each partner
		  depend significantly on their relative incomes and ages and
		  on the level of lifetime wealth. These effects are highly
		  significant in a statistical sense. They also suggest that
		  the influence of differential incomes and wealth on
		  intrahousehold allocation can be fairly substantial.'"

                  on parents and their adult children to test the
                  standard altruism model. This model predicts that,
                  within the extended family, the distribution of
                  consumption is independent of the distribution of
                  resources. Our findings strongly reject this

		  explored in the context of a two-sex overlapping
		  generations model where men and women of each generation
		  bargain over consumption, number of children, and
		  investment in education of their children. It is shown that
		  the gender difference implied by the model is smaller than
		  the one that would result from a pure investment model. The
		  model is used to estimate the cost to a woman of having a
		  child. The estimate obtained is about 5% of the working

     abstract = {This paper considers the use of instrumental
                  variables to estimate the mean effect of treatment
                  on the treated, the mean effect of treatment on
                  randomly selected persons and the local average
                  treatment effect. It examines what economic
                  questions these parameters address. When responses
                  to treatment vary, the standard argument justifying
                  the use of instrumental variables fails unless
                  person-specific responses to treatment do not
                  influence decisions to participate in the program
                  being evaluated. This requires that individual gains
                  from the program that cannot be predicted from
                  variables in outcome equations do not influence the
                  decision of the persons being studied to participate
                  in the program. In the likely case in which
                  individuals possess and act on private information
                  about gains from the program that cannot be fully
                  predicted by variables in the outcome equation,
                  instrumental variables methods do not estimate
                  economically interesting evaluation
                  parameters. Instrumental variable methods are
                  extremely sensitive to assumptions about how people
                  process information. These arguments are developed
                  for both continuous and discrete treatment variables
                  and several explicit economic models are presented.},
