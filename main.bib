  abstract	= {We present the evidence of government intervention in
		  rural credit markets of LDC's in the past three decades and
		  confront it with modern theory. That evidence shows a
		  significant failure of subsidized credit programs either to
		  achieve an increase of agricultural output cost-effectively
		  or to improve rural income distribution and alleviate
		  poverty. In addition, many of the financial institutions
		  that were created to channel rural credit have been shown
		  to be inept and lacking accountability. Modern theory has
		  focused mostly on two areas, credit rationing in
		  competitive markets and interlinking of credit contracts
		  with labor and land contracts. We outline the policy
		  implications of these thories and find them insufficient to
		  account for the empirical evidence. We contend that a more
		  systematic and rigorous analysis of institutions and
		  institutional environments is essential for understanding
		  and implementing effective policy reforms of rural credit
		  markets. We present suggestions for undertaking such an
		  analysis.}

		  literature, the problems of moral hazard and adverse
		  selection are assumed to be decisive for the organaization
		  of agrarian institutions. In contrast, it is found that in
		  the four villages surveyed credit transactions take
		  advantage of the free flow of information within rural
		  communities. Information asymmetries between borrower and
		  lender are unimportant, and their institutional
		  consequences --- the use of collateral and interlinked
		  contracts --- are absent. Credit transactions play a direct
		  role in pooling risk between households through the use of
		  contracts in which the repayment owed by the borrower
		  depends on the realization of random production shocks by
		  both the borrower and the lender.}
